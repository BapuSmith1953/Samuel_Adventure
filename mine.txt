You climb down deeper and deeper into the mine, until you reach a floor with a tunnel leading away.
All of a sudden you hear a loud crack and the sound of rocks breaking and falling up above you!
You quickly jump out of the way, just in time, as a huge pile of rocks falls down behind you.
You cannot go back up the mine shaft
You have no choice but to follow the tunnel and see where it goes.
