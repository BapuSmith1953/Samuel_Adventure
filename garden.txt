You are walking through Yayaâ€™s Garden.
You notice a pretty butterfly with blue wings is flying near the phlox in the garden.
You see a gate standing open at the back of the yard, and another gate leading to the front yard.
A grabber is lying on the ground near the gate.
An owl is watching you from the trees nearby.
There is a swing back by the fence and nearby there is a pile of sticks.
