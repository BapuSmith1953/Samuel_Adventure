You hear the rumbling of heavy trucks and the shouts of construction workers.
Soon you recognize the construction site where a new house has been built.
The workers are all leaving for the day.
You are curious and want to see the heavy equipment up close, especially the big yellow excavator.
Suddenly, you see the little yellow robot. He runs into a hole down by the house.
You walk down onto the construction site to get a better look at that hole, but the hole is dark inside and too small for you to climb into.
