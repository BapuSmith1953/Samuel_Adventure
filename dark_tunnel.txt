As you walk farther into the tunnel, you see dim lights up ahead, along the side of the path.
These lights guide you deeper into the tunnel.
For a long time  you walk, not hearing any sound except the drip-drip-drip of water.
Then you see a mine shaft going down deep underground.
There is an old sign by the mine shaft.
