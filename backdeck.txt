You are standing on the back deck at Yayaâ€™s house.
It is a warm sunny day, so there is no wood or fire in the fire pit.
You see on the table several objects.
The flowers are blooming in the garden.
There are stairs going down into the garden.
You see an open gate leading to the front side of the house.
